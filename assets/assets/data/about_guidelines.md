### From the Clinical Practice Guidelines
Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and other autonomic dysfunctions are commonly seen after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, since SCI is relatively uncommon and the stigmata of AD and autonomic dysfunction are relatively unique to this population, few clinicians, except those who treat persons with SCI regularly, have encountered these conditions. As a result, it is thought that AD, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality when unrecognized or poorly managed, is not uncommonly misdiagnosed in the community.


There are 2 reasons for this: First, the people who are most prone to developing AD typically have low baseline blood pressures, and a significant increase in blood pressure may not be appreciated by an evaluating medical provider; second, the most obvious and distressing symptom, a severe headache, is commonly seen in other conditions. Other autonomic dysfunctions, while perhaps less life-threatening than AD, can certainly impact the lives of persons with SCI significantly and likely remain undertreated as well.


This clinical practice guideline (CPG), similar to its preceding versions, is anticipated to remain one of the most important of the Consortium for SCI Medicine CPGs regarding its potential impact on the care of persons with SCI. Not unsurprisingly, the AD CPG and its companion consumer guide, first developed over 2 decades ago, have historically been among the most popular publications of the Consortium for SCI Medicine. This updated CPG has been significantly expanded in scope to address specific scenarios in which AD might be expected to be encountered, including urological procedures, labor and delivery, and self-induced AD (“boosting”). To this end, this CPG includes contributing experts from other fields that were not represented previously, as well as other autonomic dysfunctions that were not previously addressed such as orthostatic hypotension, temperature, and sweating dysregulation.

We hope that this wide-ranging representation will translate into uniform quality practice through the widespread use of this CPG to guide the prevention and treatment of AD and other autonomic dysfunctions in all settings, which can only result in the best outcomes and least amount of morbidity and mortality for those who experience SCI.)

[comment]: <> (On behalf of the consortium steering committee, I want first to acknowledge the leadership of the guideline panel, namely the Co-Chairs, Andrei Krassioukov and Todd Linsenmeyer, in guiding this panel inexorably through the development process. Next to be commended are the panel members themselves for keeping to task and the many reviewers who provided valuable feedback from all areas. All of these people, including the panel Chair and Co-Chair, have volunteered their time to help produce this superb document. In addition, I wish to acknowledge the ongoing support of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, especially President David Zurfluh, Executive Director Carl Blake, and Director of Research and Education Cheryl Vines, as well as the rest of the leadership team without whose support these guidelines would not exist.)
