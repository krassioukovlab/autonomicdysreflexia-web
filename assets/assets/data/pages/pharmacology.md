### Treatment

1. Calcium Channel blockers
   1. Nifedipine 10 mg SL (takes 30 min to abort attack)
2. ACE Inhibitors
   1. Captopril 12.5-25 mg SL or PO (25mg ≈ Nifedipine 10 mg)
      Onset: <10 min SL, or <30 min PO
3. Nitrates (e.g. Nitroglycerin)
   1. SL (spray), transdermal (remove if hypotensive)
   2. IV if severe AD persists
4. **α**-blocker (Prazosin)
   1. 1 mg PO (caveat: can precipitously drop BP)

If AD continues to persist, transfer to ICU or other unit capable of providing permanet cardiorespiratory monitoring.

Re-screen for other causes of AD.

5. Consider regional or general anesthesia as last resort.

#### Caveates

Vasodilator use can cause hypotension, monitor patient BP and remind patient to communicate symptomatic hypotension.

Reminder: PDE5 inhibitors contraindicate nitrates (and provide BP-lowering effects in of themselves). (Increasing use in *females* with SCI as well)
