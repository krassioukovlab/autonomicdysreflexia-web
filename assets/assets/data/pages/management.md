## Management strategies

If AD is diagnosed, identify & treat triggers.

*In the context of elevated BP:*

1. Immediately sit the individual up and lower legs (orthostatic decrease in BP), if possible. (III, C, Strong agreement)
2. Monitor BP and pulse frequently (every 1-2 minutes) until individual is stabilized (III, C, Strong agreement)
3. Loosen any clothing or constrictive devices
4. Assess individual for having taken a vasopressor or antihypertensive agent (V, C, Strong agreement)
5. Survey for other triggers, beginning with the urinary system. (III, C, Strong agreement)
6. Catheterize individual if indwelling catheter not in place. (V, C, Strong agreement)
7. If sBP â‰¥ 150 prior to catheterization, consider rapid-onset & short duration antihypertensive without causing hypotension
8. Potential rapid/short-acting antihypertensives include nitropaste, nifedipine, hydralazine, or sublingual clonidine). (V, C, Strong agreement)
   1. **Nitrates:** Inquire first if individual has taken a recent phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) (II, B, Strong agreement)
