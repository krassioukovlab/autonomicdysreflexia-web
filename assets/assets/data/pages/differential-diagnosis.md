The differential diagnosis is broad, including unrelated causes of hypertension. This is

### Triggers

#### Urinary Tract

* Bladder / Urethra: indwelling and blocked catheter, urethral strictures (resulting in bladder distension), detrusor overactivity
* Infections / inflammation: Cystitis, pyelonephritis
* Renal stones
* Diagnostic Interventions (e.g. urodynamics, cystoscopy, shock-wave lithotripsy)
* Trauma: Kidney laceration/infarct, testicular torsion, scrotal compression

#### GI Tract

* Bowel distension: constipation, flatulence, impaction, ileus
* Foreign bodies
* Infections / Inflammation: Appendicitis, cholelithiasis Â± cholecystitis, inflammatory bowel disease, esophagitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, ulceration (e.g. H. pylori)
* Hemorrhoids
* Post-surgery

#### Skin, activity, attire

* **Skin**: Pressure ulcers, ingrown toenails, dermatitis, venous/arterial ulcer, microangiopathy necrosis, trauma (e.g. burns, lacerations). (Rare: Toxic shock syndrome)
* **Sexual Activity:** genital stimulation, STIs, orgasm, ejaculation, trauma (e.g. priapism, penile fracture)
* **Reproductive System:** menstruation, endometriosis, pregnancy (uterine contractions, labour and delivery)
* ... and other conditions causing **pain** or sympathetic arousal (e.g. anxiety, ingrown toenails, fractures, menstruation, hemorrhoids, sexual intercourse, sunburns, etc.)

### Other causes of hypertension

The causes of hypertension can be exacerbated in an individual with SCI due to loss of control over the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system below the level of the injury.

Other causes of hypertension, in the right individual include:

* Previously listed ife threatening neurologic/cardiovascular causes (see **primer**)
* Sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema
* Preeclampsia/Eclampsia
* Scleroderma renal crisis
* Acute glomerulonephritis
* Volume overload
* Drug use or overdose (e.g stimulants, especially alcohol, cocaine, or Synthroid)
* Renal Artery Stenosis
* Nephritic and nephrotic syndrome
* Polycystic kidney disease
* Tyramine reaction
* Cushing's syndrome
* Obstructive sleep apnea
* Pheochromocytoma
* Hyperaldosteronism
* Hyperthyroidism
* Oral contraceptive use
