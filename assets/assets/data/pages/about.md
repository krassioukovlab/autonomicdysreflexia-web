| Level | Description of Evidence & Strength of Expert Panel Agreement                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I     | Evidence based on RCTs or meta-analysis of adequate size                                                                                                                                                         |
| II    | Evidence based on RCTs too small to provide level I evidence. May show either positive trends that are not statistically significant or no trends and are associated with a high risk of false-negative results. |
| III   | Evidence based on nonrandomized, controlled, or cohort studies; case series; case-controlled studies; or cross-sectional studies.                                                                                |
| IV    | Evidence based on the opinion of respected authorities or expert committees as indicated in published consensus conferences or guidelines.                                                                       |
| V     | Evidence that expresses the opinion of those individuals who have written and reviewed this guideline, based on experience, knowledge of the relevant literature, and discussions with peers.                    |


| Category | Strength of Evidence Associated with the Recommendations |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A        | Supported by one or more Level I studies.                |
| B        | Supported by one or more Level II studies.               |
| C        | Supported by only one or more Level III, IV or V studies |


| Level    | Level of Panel Agreement with Recommendations (Mean Agreement Score) |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low      | 1.0 to < 2.33                                                        |
| Moderate | 2.33 to <3.87                                                        |
| Strong   | 3.87 to 5.0                                                          |
