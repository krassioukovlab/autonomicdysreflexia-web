## Diagnostic Criteria
Typically episodes of AD are seen in individuals with T6
- An elevated systolic BP greater than *20 mmHg* above their usual baseline* (*15 mmHg* in children).
- An episode of AD can be symptomatic or asymptomatic.

##### *Compared to the general population, adults with SCI are likely to have lower systolic BP. If you don't have a baseline, you may need to use this estimate. In seated resting position, adults with injuries above T6 will have an average systlolic BP ~100 mmHg.

Potential symptoms and signs of AD could include: 
- Sudden-onset headache
- Possible bradycardia or tachycardia (i)
- Cardiac arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, and atrioventricular conduction abnormalities
- Profuse sweating and/or flushing of the skin, typically (face, neck, shoulders) above the level of the injury. (But also possibly below the lesion)
