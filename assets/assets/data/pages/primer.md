### At a glance

In general, individuals with SCI have a low baseline blood pressure (BP) compared to the general population.

AD is a constellation of signs and/or symptoms after SCI in response to noxious or non-noxious stimuli below the level of injury. In general, this affects individuals with SCI at or above T6.

###### Pathophysiology

Individuals with injuries at spinal level **T6** and above are the most susceptible because loss of central nervous system control over splanchnic circulation occurs at this level, which then allows these large vascular beds to become involved in sympathetic overactivity. Ultimately, individuals will have a hypertensive crisis.

The full primer on AD by Cragg and Krassioukov can be seen online ([Can. Med. Assoc. J., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255181/)).

#### Life-Threatening Complications

While uncommon, there are several severe complications of Autonomic Dysreflexia that can cause permanent damage and death.

* Acute Aortic Dissection
* Neurologic involvement, including:
  * Aphasia
  * Blindness, hemianopia, or extreme blurred vision
  * Cognitive impairment (including syncope & short-term memory defects)
  * Hemorrhage (basal ganglia, cerebellar, intracerebral, intraventricular, subarachnoid, etc.)
  * Intracerebral infarction
  * Hypertensive encephalopathy
  * Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
  * Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome
  * Seizures (focal to generalized tonic-clonic) and status epilepticus
* Cardiac involvement, including:
  * Cardiac arrest
  * Miocardial Infarction / ischemia
  * Coronary vasospasm
