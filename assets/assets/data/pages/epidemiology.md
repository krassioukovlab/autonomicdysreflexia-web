In general, individuals with SCI have a low baseline blood pressure (BP) compared to the general population.

AD is a constellation of signs and/or symptoms after SCI in response to noxious or non-noxious stimuli below the level of injury. In general, this affects individuals with SCI at or above T6.

### Epidemiology

Commonly, individuals with a SCI at or above T6 are affected, but AD has also been detected in individuals with lower thoracic SCI, as sympathetic outflow ranges from T1 to L2.

#### Risk Factors

48 â€“ 90% of people with cervical or high thoracic SCI develop AD

\~ 90% individuals with motor complete tetraplegia
\~ 30% individuals with motor incomplete tetraplegia.
